1. Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board, was invented in 1883. Othello, a variant with a change to the board's initial setup, was patented in 1971.
2. Simple project at 2nd year in university.
3. Using SDL2 as CG(Computer Graphic) to demo.
4. Open App/Othello/CG.exe to play.

5. There are 2 modes: player vs. player and player vs. bot.
6. Bot uses Minimax optimized by Alpha-Beta Pruning and a heuristic "trial and error" reward board to calculate the optimal next move.
7. Rule:
 - Square board size >= 3 (normally 8), initial setup as below image, big dots are chesses and small dots are possible valid next move:

 - To play next move, player have to reverse opponent's chesses by cover 2 heads in horizontal or vertical or diagonal lines with single chess. Otherwise, player's move is passed.
